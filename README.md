# SCT_DS_1
 📊 Task 01: Population Age Distribution Visualization – India (2022)

# This project is part of a data analysis and visualization assignment focused on using Python to create meaningful visual representations from structured data.

## 🧾 Objective

To create a bar chart that visually represents **India’s population distribution by age groups** for the year **2022**, using official demographic data.

## 📁 Files Included

- `task01_population_chart.py` – Python script to generate the bar chart.
- `Task01_India_Age_Distribution_Explained.pdf` – Final output PDF with the bar chart and an explanation slide.
- `India_Population_Distribution_2022.pdf` – Simple bar chart based on official data.

## 📊 Data Used

Data Source: **UN World Population Prospects 2022**

| Age Group      | Population (in millions) | Percentage |
|----------------|--------------------------|------------|
| 0–20 Years     | 512                      | 36.1%      |
| 21–64 Years    | 807                      | 57.0%      |
| 65+ Years      | 98                       | 6.9%       |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- Jupyter/VS Code for development

## 📈 Output

The resulting bar chart clearly breaks down India's population into three distinct age categories. Each bar is color-coded and annotated with percentage values for better interpretability.

## 🔍 Insights

- The **working-age population (21–64 years)** forms the largest segment (57.0%), indicating strong economic potential.
- **Youth (0–20)** represent future contributors, while **elderly (65+)** indicate healthcare demand.
